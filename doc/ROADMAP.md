# ChromatiX Roadmap

The migration is done ([MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md)): no encrypted/vendor IP is left, only the
MiSTer Game Boy core stays in Verilog, and the USB device core is LiteUSB (the native LiteX/Migen
port of LUNA). Next steps:

## LiteX dev board demos

- **LiteX BIOS demo** (done: `--with-bios`): a VexRiscv SoC running the LiteX BIOS, with its console
  on the LCD (and so over UVC) and on the USB CDC port, and 4MB of PSRAM as main RAM to run firmware
  (serialboot). Done: CPU at 33MHz, firmware demo (`firmware/demo`: buttons, tone generator, LCD
  console). Next: more firmware (games/tools using the LCD framebuffer).
- Other cores on the Chromatic (retro cores, RISC-V SoCs, accelerators) reusing the platform, video
  pipeline, USB (UVC/UAC/CDC) and the debug/automation loop.

## Upstreaming

- LiteX (done): GW5A SerDes/IODELAY primitives and `SerDesTristate`, the USB 2.0 UTMI soft PHY
  (`usb2_phy`), LunaCDCACM UTMI mode, the x8 OPI PSRAM core (`ram/opi_psram`), Gowin PLL generated
  clock constraints. ChromatiX uses them.
- litex-boards (done): `modretro_chromatic` target (High-Speed USB CDC-ACM console, PSRAM main RAM,
  LCD/HDMI, I2S audio, buttons). Next: battery ADC, codec control.

## Tooling

- Verilator simulation (done: `chromatix_sim.py`, Game Boy core + cartridge or virtual cartridge
  + buttons + LCD capture, video pipeline on a PSRAM model with the panel/UVC output capture). Next:
  OSD (ESP32 QSPI writes model), audio capture.
- CI: re-enable once the GitHub Actions account billing issue is solved.
